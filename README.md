# RISC-V-32I
Introduction:
This project explores the implementation and performance evaluation of the RISC-V RV32I architecture, leveraging the PRESENT-80 encryption algorithm to demonstrate its capabilities. The RISC-V architecture, known for its simplicity, efficiency, and scalability, is increasingly regarded as a viable option for educational and research applications in the field of embedded systems and cryptography.

Aim:
The study is rooted in the design and simulation of a custom single-cycle processor that operates the RV32I instruction set. Utilising SystemVerilog and the Vivado design suite, the processor was meticulously constructed and tested against the PRESENT-80 cryptographic algorithm to assess its performance under realistic encryption tasks.

Core Findings
Instruction Performance: Analysis of the processor's execution times revealed that optimised code can significantly enhance the processing speed. This detailed how variations in instruction length affected overall performance, providing insights into effective optimisation instructions combination.
